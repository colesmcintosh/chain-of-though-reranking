# chain-of-though-reranking
an innovative approach to optimizing large language model (LLM) responses by extracting, reranking, and refining their internal chain-of-thought (CoT). By focusing on the most coherent and relevant parts of the CoT, we can minimize contradictory reasoning and potentially reduce token usageâ€”ultimately leading to more reliable and efficient outputs.
